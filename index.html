                            At the top of any best of true crime list must be
                            the book that
                            revolutionized the genre. Capote’s 1966 “nonfiction
                            novel” about
                            the brutal murder of a Kansas family in 1959 is a
                            page-turner
                            that honors the victims even while displaying
                            empathy for the
                            perpetrators.</p>

                            The queen of true crime wrote dozens of books, but
                            Ann Rule’s
                            masterpiece is her particularly harrowing debut. In
                            The Stranger
                            Beside Me, Rule describes her personal relationship
                            with a
                            co-worker whom she later realizes is a serial
                            killer: the handsome
                            and charming—and prolific—murderer Ted Bundy.</p>

                        <p>Skip Fatal Vision, the true crime book written by a
                            journalist who
                            was embedded with a man who was ultimately convicted
                            for killing
                            his pregnant wife and their two other children.
                            Instead, get more
                            meta and read ace cultural critic Janet Malcolm’s
                            study of the
                            relationship between the two men in The Journalist
                            and the Murderer.
                            It’s more thrilling than any book about ethics in
                            crime journalism
                            has any right to be.

                        <h1>THE RED PARTS: Autobiography of a Trial by Maggie
                            Nelson</h1>
                        <p>Bluets and The Argonauts author Maggie Nelson is best
                            known for
                            her literary nonfiction writing, but her foray into
                            true crime is
                            an accessible and intriguing entry point into her
                            work. As a child,
                            the murder of her aunt by a presumed serial killer
                            haunted her and
                            the rest of her family. When new DNA evidence pins
                            the blame on
                            another suspect, Nelson observes the new trial with
                            the eye of a
                            loving daughter and niece, as well as a deep and
                            skeptical thinker.
